## Introduction:  
<div align="justify">This repository contains a solution for the assignment of building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The assignment is based on a dataset provided by BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, which aims to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market.</div>

## Problem Statement:  
<div align="justify">A US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes company has faced revenue challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and the company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. The company aims to develop a robust business plan to boost revenues and economy restores to a healthy state. The goal is to understand the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market, identifying significant variables, and creating a predictive model for management decision-making.

Specifically, the company wants to know:<br>
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.<br>
- How well those variables describe the bike demands.</div>

## Objectives:  
<div align="justify">The main objective of this assignment is to create a model using a provided dataset, identifying significant variables to predict shared bike demand. The model will help BoomBikes to understand how demand varies with different features, allowing them to adjust their business strategy to meet customer expectations and capitalize on market dynamics.</div>

## Analysis Approach:  
<div align="justify">To tackle this problem effectively, I have established a structured data analysis approach.

- Data Preprocessing:<br> It includes understanding, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, dropping unnecessary columns, and standardizing data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>Exploring the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the dataset. This will involve univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

- Visualizations:<br>It includes creating visual representations of the data to facilitate a better understanding of the insights, trends, and relationships.

- Feature Importance:<br>Identifying key variables that strongly influence target variables using statistical methods such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

- Model Building:<br>It includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, performing scaling, partition the data into features (X) and the target variable (Y) and performing linear regression analysis on the dataset.

- Model Evaluation:<br>It includes evaluating and validating the different assumptions, examining the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values.</div>

## Key Findings:
<div align="justify">In conclusion, the analysis has identified key variables that significantly impact the demand for shared bikes. These include: 

- year<br>
- holiday<br>
- temp<br>
- windspeed<br>
- sep<br>
- Light_snowrain<br>	
- Misty<br>
- spring<br>
- summer <br>
- winter</div>

## Recommendations:  
<div align="justify">After examining the model, it is advisable for the company to focus on the following key factors:

- Concentrate on extending business operations in September.<br>
- With an increase in temperature, the demand also increases, so it is crucial to monitor and record changes in weather conditions.<br>
- During the winter season the demand increases, so the company should be well prepared to meet the high demand.</div>
